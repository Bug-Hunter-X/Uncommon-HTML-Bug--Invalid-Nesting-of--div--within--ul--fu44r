# Uncommon HTML Bug: Invalid Nesting of <div> within <ul>

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to incorrect nesting of elements.  Specifically, a `<div>` element is incorrectly nested within an unordered list (`<ul>`). This is semantically invalid and can lead to unexpected rendering and accessibility problems.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code.  The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code.

## Bug Description

Incorrectly nested HTML elements can lead to unexpected rendering and layout issues, as well as accessibility problems.  Browsers may handle invalid nesting in different ways, leading to inconsistent results across different browsers.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the HTML to ensure semantically correct nesting. In this case, the `<div>` element should be placed outside the `<ul>` or restructured within a more appropriate context.
